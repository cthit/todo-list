# Todo list

This repository contains examples of implementing a web application with a React frontend with a running backend. There are several basic implementations of the backend using [Go](https://golang.org/doc/), [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) (Javascript) and [Sprint Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) (Java).
\
All backend applications will run on `localhost:8080`, so only one backend kan run at a time.

## Software

You will have to install some software to be able of running the applications.

### React Frontend and Node Backend

Both the `frontend` and `node_backend` runs on NodeJs and requires you to [install NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Go Backend

The `go_backend` is written in Go (or Golang) which require you to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Spring Boot backend

The spring `sprint_backend` is using java 8 and maven which require you to [install jdk8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) and [install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (or and editor supporting Maven like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html)).

## Editors

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (aka VsCode or Code) is a lightweight and customizable editor, recommended to be used when programming in JavaScript but can also be used for any other language.

### IntelliJ IDEA

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) is a great editor for development in Java. It has a lot of handy features for testing, building and running you application. As a Chalmers student you have access to the ultimate edition if you create a [student account](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) on JetBrains.

### GoLand

[GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) is similar to to IntelliJ but for Go. When programming in Go it is recommended you either use GoLand or VsCode.
